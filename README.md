Analysis of renewable energy consumption and efficiency using SAS

Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing hourly information about energy consumption and renewable energy sources (wind, solar, and hydro). Each observation corresponds to one hour and includes indicators such as the hour of the day, day of the week, total energy consumption, and the contribution of each renewable source.

The main objectives of this project are to:

- Understand the distribution and efficiency of renewable (green) energy.
- Identify patterns based on hours of the day and days of the week.
- Estimate monthly and yearly trends in renewable energy usage.
- Build prediction models using statistical and machine learning techniques.

## Files
- [Renewable energy report (PDF)](./Renewable%20energy%20sources.pdf)
- [Energy dataset (CSV)](./energie_regresie.csv)

## How to use
1. Open the PDF for the detailed analysis.
2. Use the CSV file as input for the SAS or other data analysis scripts.
